# Text Summarization Project

## Project Overview

This project is dedicated to developing a text summarization tool using advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The objective is to create a system that can automatically condense long pieces of text into concise summaries while retaining the key information and meaning.

## Features

- **Automatic Text Summarization**: Generates concise and relevant summaries from input text.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive user interface for ease of use.
- **Support for Multiple Languages**: Capable of summarizing text in various languages.
- **Customizable Summary Length**: Allows users to specify the desired length of the summary.
- **Integration with Popular Platforms**: Easily integrates with web applications and other platforms via APIs.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core programming language for the project.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Utilizing libraries like NLTK, spaCy, and transformers for text processing and summarization.
- **Machine Learning**: Leveraging models such as BERT, GPT-3, and T5 for advanced summarization capabilities.
- **Flask**: A lightweight web framework to create the web interface.
- **Docker**: For containerization to ensure the application runs consistently across different environments.
